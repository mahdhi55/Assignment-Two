 <p>Somaliland is an autonomous independent region in the Horn of Africa located at the gate of the Suez Canal parallel Yemen. 
 Formerly a British colony it first gained its independence on the 26th of June 1960 before joining with the southern Italian colonies five days later to form the a united Somalia.
 Following the collapse of the united Somalia in 1991 and the subsequent civil war Somaliland renewed its independence from the south in the 19th of May 1991.
 Somaliland now is one of the few stable democracies in the horn with its own free and fair elections and a lack of the violence and terrorism which corrupts the surrounding regions.
 This website hopes to educate potential travellers and investors of Somaliland's unique longstanding history of settlement, and accurately represent its case for independence. </p>
