<h1> History of Somaliland </h1>
<h2>Somaliland in Pre and Ancient History</h2>
<section>
<p>The region of Somaliland has been a location of human settlement since at least the Paleolitihic era, though likely not by a people that were distinguishably Somali.
 Linguists believe that afroasiatic speakers arrived from the proposed urheimat or homeland of the Nile Valley in the neolithic era. Somaliland specifically has been proposed as the most location
 for the Ancient Land of Punt, which in turn was the urheimat for the early Ancient Egyptian Dynasties.</p>

<h2>Somaliland: From Middle Ages to Colonisation </h2>
<section>
<p>In the late 6th century Somaliland was one of the first regions outside of the Arabian peninsula to recieve the Abrahamic religion of Islam to to its frequent trading with the region. 
Islamic Sultanates started propping up in the region the most dominant of which was the 14th century Adal Sultanate which allied with the Ottoman empire in regional battles against the Portugese and Ethiopian Christian neighbours.
Somaliland is one of the few regions to withstand a Portugese invasion during the height of the European empires power. Zeila, which had long been the capital of the Adal Sultanate became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 1500s alongside
Berbera, the main port, the rest of the country remained free. In 1885 after fierce resistance treaties were signed which incorporated Somaliland into the British Empire. It remained a part until 1961 when it gained independence and united with southern Somalia
which had previously been under Italian rule.</p>

<h2>Somaliland during the Civil War</h2>
<section>
<p>In 1988 the government of Somalia began bombing Hargeisa, the current capital of Somaliland and at the time second largest city of Somalia, alongside Burao, the former nations third largest city also in present-day Somaliland. 
This was largely due to targeted discrimation by longserving dictator Siad Barre against the Isaaq tribe who subsequently formed the Somaliland National Movement and fought the Somaliland War of Independence. The reaction was far from proportionate though.
Conservative estimates somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 Isaaq civillians died in the government crackdowns. A U.N. investigation found that Siad Barre's government had attempted a calculated genocide of the Isaaq population. After this dark marr on our history
independence was formally established in 1991.</p>
