<h1>Geography and Wildlife of Somaliland</h1>
<h2>Ports and Agriculture</h2>
<section>
<p>Somaliland's history is closely intertwined with its history as a port city.
 Due to its strategic location at the foot of the Suez Canal it has long been part of the Silk Road trade route
 exporting its native frankincense and myyrh and importing goods from as far as East Asia into interior Africa.
 In fact some of the first historical records we have of human settlement in Somaliland come from Ancient Greece describing the port city states of the region.
 Ports remain an important lifeline for Somaliland today. Berbera, the main port and was acquired by DP World in 2016, a United Arab Emirates company, in hopes of improving trade routes to landlocked Ethiopia.
The climate of Somaliland is invariably arid to semi-arid, with the farmer being far more likely. As such agricultural lifestyles are not common and it is primarily a nomadic lifestyle which in turn exports livestock to surrounding Arabia. </p>

<h2>Landmarks and Heritage Sites</h2>
<section>
<p>Due to its long history of human settlement and proximity to the cradle of humanity Somaliland is teeming with heritage sites the whole world can be proud of. Outside the capital Hargeisa lies the Laas Geel caves which dates back about 5000 years 
and is widely considered one of the most vivid paintings of its type in Africa. Parts of Somaliland also posess untouched British colonial architecture from its time as part of the empire as well as older Ottoman style buildings especially centering around the ports.
Somaliland was one of the first country's outside Arabia to recieve and adopt the religion of Islam alongside Persia and as such has mosques which are arranged facing towards Jerusalem as opposed to the later adopted Mecca in Saudi Arabia. These are considered important
cultural touchstones for the majority Muslim population.</p>
</section>
<h2>Tourism and Leisure</h2>
<section>
<p>Heritage sites such as Laas Geel attract both international and domestic tourism alongside the preserved colonial and antiquity era heritage of the region. Additionally Hargeisa has many natural leisure wonders such as the Lamadaya waterfalls located
in the Cal Madow mountains and beautiful Berbera beach. Tourism is also attracted by the people of Somaliland themselves, many of whom still practice the traditional nomadic culture in hard conditions with a valiant spirit.</p>
